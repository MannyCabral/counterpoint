I'm playing around with creating a program for Species Counterpoint as it was taught in my MIT 21M.051 Fundamentals of Music class.

The rules are as follows:
1) Determine the key signature
2) List note options
  a) Consonant internals: Unison, m3 or M3, P5, m6 or M6, P8 above (or any of those intervals +/- octaves)
  b) No added accidentals!
3) Rules to follow when picking notes:
  a) No parallel octaves/unisons.
  b) No leaps more than a P4 in melody.
    i) But you can change the octave of a note to solve that problem!
  c) No more than two leaps per 4 melodic intervals.
  d) No more than two 3rds (major or minor), 6ths (major or minor), or P5s in a row.
  e) Do not write the same note twice in a row.
4) Select notes that follow the rules, are as smooth as possible, and create a beautiful melody!
